GAME	:	BOX BUILDING

ABOUT THE GAME :
	I don't know the exact name of this game. The main theme of this game is to build as many boxes as you can by connecting the given dots, so I named this game as box building. And this is an two player game. 


How to play :
	At first You need to connect any two given dots, you can use the row number mention in the game then you can choose the place holder where you want to create a line. And now its your opponent's turn. Players will get an extra chance if they successfully created a box. After all the possible dots are connected the one who occupied more boxes will wins the game.

All The Best!!!
